Fix Railway Deployment: No module named 'torch'

## Problem
Railway deployment fails with "No module named 'torch'" despite torch being in:
- pyproject.toml [api] dependencies
- requirements-railway.txt
- nixpacks.toml

Root causes:
1. Python version mismatch (nixpacks.toml: 3.10, actual: 3.12)
2. Nixpacks unreliable for heavy dependencies like torch
3. Build commands not executing properly

## Solution
Switch from Nixpacks to Dockerfile for deterministic builds.

### Changes Made

1. **Dockerfile.railway** (NEW)
   - Uses Python 3.10-slim-bullseye (fixed version)
   - Installs torch+transformers in separate layer (better caching)
   - Verifies installation before proceeding (fail fast)
   - Includes Vietnamese embedding module load test

2. **railway.json** (UPDATED)
   - Builder: NIXPACKS → DOCKERFILE
   - DockerfilePath: Dockerfile.railway

3. **vietnamese_embed.py** (ENHANCED)
   - Added comprehensive debug logging
   - Shows Python version, sys.path, installed packages
   - Detailed torch import diagnostics
   - Helps identify root cause if errors persist

4. **Documentation** (NEW)
   - RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_FIX_TORCH.md: Technical details
   - RAILWAY_VIETNAMESE_DEPLOY.md: User-friendly guide
   - deploy-railway.sh: Automated deployment script

### Benefits
✅ Deterministic builds (same result every time)
✅ Explicit Python 3.10 (no version drift)
✅ Guaranteed torch installation (separate pip step)
✅ Early failure detection (verification step)
✅ Better caching (torch layer cached separately)
✅ Comprehensive logging (debug if needed)

### Verification
Build logs should show:
- ✅ Torch 2.x.x installed successfully
- ✅ Transformers installed successfully
- ✅ Vietnamese embedding module loaded
- ✅ All verifications passed

### Deployment
```bash
./deploy-railway.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
git push origin main
# Railway auto-detects and builds
```

### Files Changed
- Dockerfile.railway (new)
- railway.json (updated)
- vietnamese_embed.py (enhanced logging)
- RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_FIX_TORCH.md (new)
- RAILWAY_VIETNAMESE_DEPLOY.md (new)
- deploy-railway.sh (new)
